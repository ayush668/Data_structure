    "'''\n",
    "Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists because of their immutability. This makes them ideal for storing large collections of data when modification is not required.\n",

    "Sets offer average O(1) time complexity for membership tests (i.e., checking if an element exists in the set), making them faster than lists for such operations.\n",
